      "introduction": "Managing a hardware shop in Kenya—whether in the heart of Kamukunji or a growing town like Kitengela—is a logistical challenge. With thousands of SKUs ranging from tiny nails to heavy cement bags, tracking stock manually is a recipe for loss. This guide provides a professional-grade Excel template designed specifically for the Kenyan hardware context, including VAT and e-TIMS preparation columns.",

          "body": "Hardware retail is unique because of 'break-bulk' sales (selling items from a larger pack) and high-frequency transactions. Without a template, you face stockouts of fast-movers like D12 rebars or overstocking slow-movers. In the Kenyan market, price fluctuations for items like cement and steel require a system that can update margins instantly. Our template includes columns for 'Last Purchase Price' and 'Target Margin' to ensure you never sell at a loss during inflation."

Track by 'Piece', 'Bag', 'Kilogram', or 'Meter'. \n3. **Reorder Levels:** Set a minimum threshold for essentials like 32.5N cement so the template flags when it's time to restock. \n4. **Supplier Directory:** Link each item to a preferred supplier in Nairobi or local distributors for faster turnaround."

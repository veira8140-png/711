Hardware owners here face unique challenges: high turnover, complex pricing structures, and the need for rapid M-Pesa reconciliation. Traditional ETR machines are no longer enough. \n\nVeira offers a cloud-based solution that works offline, ensuring that even when the internet fluctuates in areas like Eastleigh or Westlands, your sales never stop. Our system is specifically engineered to handle the high SKU counts typical of hardware retail, allowing you to track every nail and every iron sheet with precision. In a city where speed is everything, having a system that processes transactions in under 3 seconds is a massive competitive advantage."

We've seen Nairobi businesses reduce their audit risk by 90% simply by switching to an automated VSCU-linked system. Whether you are operating in the CBD or the outskirts of Rongai, staying compliant is the only way to protect your margins from heavy penalties."

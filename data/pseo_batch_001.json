Many business owners struggle with manual ledgers that are prone to errors and staff manipulation. This professional Excel template is designed to bring 'Big Data' precision to your local shop, allowing you to track sales, expenses, and net profit with zero guesswork.",

With high staff turnover and the complexity of M-Pesa transactions, a paper-based system often hides 'leakages' (theft) and inventory shrinkage. By using a structured Excel template, you create a digital audit trail. This template allows you to categorize sales by payment method—Cash vs. M-Pesa—which is critical for daily reconciliation. In a city where 'float' management is key, knowing exactly how much cash should be in the drawer at 6:00 PM is your first line of defense against operational loss."

Instead of asking a customer to navigate their Sim Toolkit or dial a USSD code, your POS triggers a prompt directly on their phone screen. They only need to enter their PIN. This reduces friction, speeds up queues, and eliminates the risk of customers entering the wrong Till or Paybill number.",

Ufuatiliaji wa mauzo (Sales Tracking) ni mchakato wa kurekodi kila shilingi inayongia na inayotoka. Bila ufuatiliaji huu, duka lako ni kama gari linaloendeshwa gizani bila taa.

      "introduction": "Eldoret is the 'Breadbasket of Kenya,' and its agrovets are the lifeblood of the farming community. Managing an agrovet is uniquely complex: you deal with seasonal demand, expiry dates on chemicals, and bulk sales of fertilizers. A standard shop system isn't enough. You need a solution that understands the 'Rhythm of the Farm.' This guide explores how Eldoret agrovets are using technology to scale their impact.",
      "sections": [
        {
          "heading": "Managing Seasonal Demand and Stock-Outs",
          "body": "In Eldoret, everyone wants fertilizer at the same time. If you run out during planting season, you lose your biggest revenue window of the year. A modern POS uses 'Historical Data' to predict these spikes. It can tell you, 'Last March you sold 500 bags of DAP; you should order 600 now to be safe.' This predictive power ensures that when the rains come, your shelves are ready for the farmers."

          "body": "Selling expired pesticides or seeds isn't just bad business—it's a legal risk. Agrovets in Eldoret are now using POS systems with 'Batch Tracking.' When you receive a new shipment of chemicals, you enter the expiry date. The system will then alert you 30 days before an item expires, allowing you to run a 'Flash Sale' or return it to the supplier. This prevents 'Dead Stock' and protects your reputation with local farmers."

          "body": "Farmers are loyal to agrovets that provide good advice and fair prices. Use your POS to create 'Farmer Profiles.' Track what they buy and when. If a farmer bought maize seeds in April, you can send them an SMS in May about the best top-dressing fertilizers. This proactive service turns a one-time buyer into a lifelong partner, which is essential in the tight-knit Eldoret agricultural community."

        { "question": "Can I track sales by 'Litre' or 'Kilogram'?", "answer": "Yes, a good agrovet POS supports 'Fractional Quantities,' allowing you to sell 500ml of a chemical from a 5L jug accurately." },
